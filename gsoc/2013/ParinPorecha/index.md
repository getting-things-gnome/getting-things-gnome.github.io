# A Web Application for Getting Things Gnome!

The application is currently deployed [here](http://gtgonline-parinporecha.rhcloud.com/user/landing/).

[Creating](creating.png) new tasks is made to work
like workflowy. You can create full task trees in GTGOnline!. Two
keywords - 'start:' and 'due:' are used to specify the start and due
dates. The rest controls are intuitive and displayed above the Task
Creator. GTGOnline! also supports Task Sharing. You can create groups (
On registering, 3 groups are created by default - 'Home', 'Friends', and
'Work' ), and add users to them. Then you can share your task/s with
them.

Choosing users to share task with is very flexible. You can either share
it with a group, and some users from other groups as well.

When a task is shared, a log of all the changes made will be created.
You can [view](view.png) all the modifications
made to that task till date (eg:- status change, edit etc.)

the link to the Launchpad branch containing the code for the backend
which synchronizes tasks between GTG and GTGOnline!

reviewed by GTG developers
