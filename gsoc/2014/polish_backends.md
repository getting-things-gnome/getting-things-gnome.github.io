## What is Getting Things Gnome! ?

Getting Things Gnome! (GTG) is an organizer for the GNOME desktop
environment, focusing on usability and ease of use. GTG manages your
to-do items easily, complete with tags and nested subtasks.

Using GTG is easy: You can create new "Tasks", to organize what you have
to do. Sometimes, you need to finish something first before being able
to accomplish your task. For that, we have "Subtasks". The purpose of
subtasks is to cut down a task in smaller subtasks that are easier to
achieve and to track down.

You can use "tags", to sort your tasks. A tag is a simple word that
begins with "@".

If you press the "Work View" button, only actionable tasks will be
displayed in your list. What is an actionable task? It's a task you can
do directly, right now.

Now one cannot carry his laptop everywhere he goes. Hence people use
other todo list managers as well for other devices. Now, wouldnt it be
nice to have a synchronization service between these apps and GTG?

## What is GTG missing?

Right now GTG does have several Synchronization services (also called
backends) to connect with services like Launchpad or Remember the Milk
and such. But many of these services have not been updated since a while
and also new services need to be added. Among the new services, the most
important ones are Gtasks and Todoist.

### How do we take care of this?

Well, the problem with Remember the milk service is that the code does
not use the latest API. For Gtasks and Todoist backends, we know about
the APIs available so should be an easy task. If you are willing to go
further than just add new backends, we are interested in a better User
Experience for Synchronization services box. We would like a box similar
to plugins.

## Info for applicants

- Knowledge of Python3 and GTK3 will be needed.
- Also, since you will be using the APIs of other projects, you must
  have an idea as to how to use them. This is not a pre requisite
  though, as you can gain this knowledge during your internship period
  as well.

## A contribution to fill the application

A vital part of the application process is getting to understand the
technologies that are going to be used in the project. Once you get a
feel of how they work, using them isn't very difficult. It would be nice
if you played with the technologies involved. Try to think how you can
integrate all the stuff you've just read into a working model.

- Once you have the confidence of putting it into action, solve a few
  bugs related to backends.
  [Here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+bugs?field.tag=backends) is a
  list of bugs that you can choose from. I'll leave the implementation
  details upto you. But remember, If you have doubts at any step, or
  something is not working as you expect it, I'm here to help, so
  don't hesitate to contact me

This is to demonstrate that you have grasped the basics and that you can
successfully combine them into something that actually works (Thats what
matters at the end, right ?). This will also convince me that you will
be willing to learn more such things during the program. When the
prototype runs, ask a developer to review the code (for code style etc.)
using launchpad or mailing-lists.
