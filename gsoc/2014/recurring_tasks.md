## What is Getting Things Gnome! ?

Getting Things Gnome! (GTG) is an organizer for the GNOME desktop
environment, focusing on usability and ease of use. GTG manages your
to-do items easily, complete with tags and nested subtasks.

Using GTG is easy: You can create new "Tasks", to organize what you have
to do. Sometimes, you need to finish something first before being able
to accomplish your task. For that, we have "Subtasks". The purpose of
subtasks is to cut down a task in smaller subtasks that are easier to
achieve and to track down.

You can use "tags", to sort your tasks. A tag is a simple word that
begins with "@".

If you press the "Work View" button, only actionable tasks will be
displayed in your list. What is an actionable task? It's a task you can
do directly, right now.

Some of the tasks that you work on will be repeating periodically. These
can be say "Pay house rent" or "Pay college fees" etc.

## What is GTG missing?

Right now GTG does not support reocurring/repeating tasks. It will be
really helpful for a user to have a support for adding repeating tasks
in one go.

### How do we add support?

The problem here is less of providing a change on GTG module and more
about deciding on a User Experience. The set of changes on GTG core side
are relatively small in amount. The main thing that you need to do is
come up with an intuitive user experience for entering the repeating
tasks. Remember GTG focuses heavily on simplicity. You can refer to
Google Calendar or the discussion on the bugs page (mentioned below) for
ideas.

So, your task is to decide on and implement a simple way of adding
support for reoccuring tasks. You need not come up with a completely out
of the box idea. It might be right in front of you.

[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/gtg/blueprints/repeated_tasks](../../pre2020/blueprints/repeated_tasks) should give
you a nice idea as to what needs to be done.

## Info for applicants

- Knowledge of Python3 and GTK3 will be needed.

## A contribution to fill the application

A vital part of the application process is getting to understand the
technologies that are going to be used in the project. Once you get a
feel of how they work, using them isn't very difficult. It would be nice
if you played with the technologies involved. Try to think how you can
integrate all the stuff you've just read into a working model.

- Once you have the confidence of putting it into action, solve a few
  bugs related to tasks and/or modify the GUI of GTG in a small way.
  I'll leave the implementation details upto you. But remember, If you
  have doubts at any step, or something is not working as you expect
  it, I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to contact me

This is to demonstrate that you have grasped the basics and that you can
successfully combine them into something that actually works (Thats what
matters at the end, right ?). This will also convince me that you will
be willing to learn more such things during the program. When the
prototype runs, ask a developer to review the code (for code style etc.)
using launchpad or mailing-lists.
